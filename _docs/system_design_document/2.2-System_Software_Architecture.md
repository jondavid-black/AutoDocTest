In this section, describe the overall system software and organization.  Include a list of software modules (this could include functions, subroutines, or classes), computer languages, and programming computer-aided software engineering tools (with a brief description of the function of each item).  Use structured organization diagrams/object-oriented diagrams that show the various segmentation levels down to the lowest level.  All features on the diagrams should have reference numbers and names.  Include a narrative that expands on and enhances the understanding of the functional breakdown.  If appropriate, use subsections to address each module.

*Note:* The diagrams should map to the FRD data flow diagrams, providing the physical process and data flow related to the FRD logical process and data flow.
