For each system that provides information exchange with the system under development, there is a requirement for rules governing the interface.  This section should provide enough detailed information about the interface requirements to correctly format, transmit, and/or receive data across the interface.  Include the following information in the detailed design for each interface (as appropriate):

- The data format requirements; if there is a need to reformat data before they are transmitted or after incoming data is received, tools and/or methods for the reformat process should be defined
- Specifications for hand-shaking protocols between the two systems; include the content and format of the information to be included in the hand-shake messages, the timing for exchanging these messages, and the steps to be taken when errors are identified
- Format(s) for error reports exchanged between the systems; should address the disposition of error reports; for example, retained in a file, sent to a printer, flag/alarm sent to the operator, etc.
- Graphical representation of the connectivity between systems, showing the direction of data flow
- Query and response descriptions

If a formal Interface Control Document (ICD) exists for a given interface, the information can be copied, or the ICD can be referenced in this section.
