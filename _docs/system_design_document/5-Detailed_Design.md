This section provides the information needed for a system development team to actually build and integrate the hardware components, code and integrate the software modules, and interconnect the hardware and software segments into a functional product.  Additionally, this section addresses the detailed procedures for combining separate COTS packages into a single system.  Every detailed requirement should map back to the FRD, and the mapping should be presented in an update to the RTM and include the RTM as an appendix to this design document.
