Interact with the Database Administrator (DBA) when preparing this section.  The section should reveal the final design of all database management system (DBMS) files and the non-DBMS files associated with the system under development.  Additional information may add as required for the particular project.  Provide a comprehensive data dictionary showing data element name, type, length, source, validation rules, maintenance (create, read, update, delete (CRUD) capability), data stores, outputs, aliases, and description.  Can be included as an appendix.
