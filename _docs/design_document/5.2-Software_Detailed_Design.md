A software module is the lowest level of design granularity in the system.  Depending on the software development approach, there may be one or more modules per system.  This section should provide enough detailed information about logic and data necessary to completely write source code for all modules in the system (and/or integrate COTS software programs).

If there are many modules or if the module documentation is extensive, place it in an appendix or reference a separate document.  Add additional diagrams and information, if necessary, to describe each module, its functionality, and its hierarchy.  Industry-standard module specification practices should be followed.  Include the following information in the detailed module designs:

- A narrative description of each module, its function(s), the conditions under which it is used (called or scheduled for execution), its overall processing, logic, interfaces to other modules, interfaces to external systems, security requirements, etc.; explain any algorithms used by the module in detail
- For COTS packages, specify any call routines or bridging programs to integrate the package with the system and/or other COTS packages (for example, Dynamic Link Libraries)
- Data elements, record structures, and file structures associated with module input and output
- Graphical representation of the module processing, logic, flow of control, and algorithms, using an accepted diagramming approach (for example, structure charts, action diagrams, flowcharts, etc.)
- Data entry and data output graphics; define or reference associated data elements; if the project is large and complex or if the detailed module designs will be incorporated into a separate document, then it may be appropriate to repeat the screen information in this section
- Report layout
