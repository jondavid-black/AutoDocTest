category: Design Document
order: '5.3'
---

If the system includes more than one component there may be a requirement for internal communications to exchange information, provide commands, or support input/output functions.  This section should provide enough detailed information about the communication requirements to correctly build and/or procure the communications components for the system.  Include the following information in the detailed designs (as appropriate):

- The number of servers and clients to be included on each area network
- Specifications for bus timing requirements and bus control
- Format(s) for data being exchanged between components
- Graphical representation of the connectivity between components, showing the direction of data flow (if applicable), and approximate distances between components; information should provide enough detail to support the procurement of hardware to complete the installation at a given location
- LAN topology
