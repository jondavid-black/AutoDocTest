This section provides the detailed design of the system and subsystem inputs and outputs relative to the user/operator.  Any additional information may be added to this section and may be organized according to whatever structure best presents the operator input and output designs.  Depending on the particular nature of the project, it may be appropriate to repeat these sections at both the subsystem and design module levels.  Additional information may be added to the subsections if the suggested lists are inadequate to describe the project inputs and outputs.
