This section is a description of the input media used by the operator for providing information to the system; show a mapping to the high-level data flows described in Section 1 .2.1, System Overview.  For example, data entry screens, optical character readers, bar scanners, etc.  If appropriate, the input record types, file structures, and database structures provided in Section 3, File and Database Design, may be referenced.  Include data element definitions, or refer to the data dictionary.

Provide the layout of all input data screens or graphical user interfaces (GUTs) (for example, windows).  Provide a graphic representation of each interface.  Define all data elements associated with each screen or GUI, or reference the data dictionary.

This section should contain edit criteria for the data elements, including specific values, range of values, mandatory/optional, alphanumeric values, and length.  Also address data entry controls to prevent edit bypassing.

Discuss the miscellaneous messages associated with operator inputs, including the following:

- Copies of form(s) if the input data are keyed or scanned for data entry from printed forms
- Description of any access restrictions or security considerations
- Each transaction name, code, and definition, if the system is a transaction-based processing system
