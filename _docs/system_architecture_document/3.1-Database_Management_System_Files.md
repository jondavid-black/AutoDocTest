This section reveals the final design of the DBMS files and includes the following information, as appropriate (refer to the data dictionary):

- Refined logical model; provide normalized table layouts, entity relationship diagrams, and other logical design information
- A physical description of the DBMS schemas, sub-schemas, records, sets, tables, storage page sizes, etc.
- Access methods (such as indexed, via set, sequential, random access, sorted pointer array, etc.)
- Estimate of the DBMS file size or volume of data within the file, and data pages, including overhead resulting from access methods and free space
- Definition of the update frequency of the database tables, views, files, areas, records, sets, and data pages; estimate the number of transactions if the database is an online transaction-based system
