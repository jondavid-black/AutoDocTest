Sensitive systems use information for which the loss, misuse, modification of, or unauthorized access to that information could affect the conduct of State programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled.

Developers of sensitive State systems are required to develop specifications for the following minimum levels of control:

- Internal security to restrict access of critical data items to only those access types required by users
- Audit procedures to meet control, reporting, and retention period requirements for operational and management reports
- Application audit trails to dynamically audit retrieval access to designated critical data
- Standard Tables to be used or requested for validating data fields
- Verification processes for additions, deletions, or updates of critical data
Ability to identify all audit information by user identification, network terminal identification, date, time, and data accessed or changed.
