This section describes the system in narrative form using non-technical terms.  It should provide a high-level system architecture diagram showing a subsystem breakout of the system, if applicable.  The high-level system architecture or subsystem diagrams should, if applicable, show interfaces to external systems.  Supply a high-level context diagram for the system and subsystems, if applicable.  Refer to the requirements trace ability matrix (RTM) in the Functional Requirements Document (FRD), to identify the allocation of the functional requirements into this design document.
