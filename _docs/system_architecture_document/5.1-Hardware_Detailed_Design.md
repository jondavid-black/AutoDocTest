A hardware component is the lowest level of design granularity in the system.  Depending on the design requirements, there may be one or more components per system.  This section should provide enough detailed information about individual component requirements to correctly build and/or procure all the hardware for the system (or integrate COTS items).

If there are many components or if the component documentation is extensive, place it in an appendix or reference a separate document.  Add additional diagrams and information, if necessary, to describe each component and its functions, adequately.  Industry-standard component specification practices should be followed.  For COTS procurements, if a specific vendor has been identified, include appropriate item names.  Include the following information in the detailed component designs (as applicable):

- Power input requirements for each component
- Signal impedances and logic states
- Connector specifications (serial/parallel, 11-pin, male/female, etc.)
- Memory and/or storage space requirements
- Processor requirements (speed and functionality)
- Graphical representation depicting the number of hardware items (for example, monitors, printers, servers, I/O devices), and the relative positioning of the components to each other
- Cable type(s) and length(s)
- User interfaces (buttons, toggle switches, etc.)
- Hard drive/floppy drive/CD-ROM requirements
- Monitor resolution
