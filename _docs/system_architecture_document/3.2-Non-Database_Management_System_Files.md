In this section, provide the detailed description of all non-DBMS files and include a narrative description of the usage of each file—including if the file is used for input, output, or both; if this file is a temporary file; an indication of which modules read and write the file, etc.; and file structures (refer to the data dictionary).  As appropriate, the file structure information should:

- Identify record structures, record keys or indexes, and reference data elements within the records
- Define record length (fixed or maximum variable length) and blocking factors
- Define file access method—for example, index sequential, virtual sequential, random access, etc.
- Estimate the file size or volume of data within the file, including overhead resulting from file access methods
- Define the update frequency of the file; if the file is part of an online transaction-based system, provide the estimated number of transactions per unit time, and the statistical mean, mode, and distribution of those transactions
